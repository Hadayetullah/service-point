                  Here’s how a professional painting or Renovation contractor
                  will help you:
                </strong>
              </p>

              <h4>Experience with preparation of painting work</h4>
              <p>
                Painting is more than just splashing paint on your walls.
                There’s a lot of prior work that goes into painting, like
                sanding, filling putty, priming and so on. And this is something
                that a professional expert painter of BD Service Point will have
                expert knowledge about and experience in painting works.
              </p>

              <h4>Expertise in different paints, shades and finishes</h4>
              <p>
                Whether we talk about interior house paints or exterior house
                paints, it is important to remember that a paint that looks like
                a perfect pick on a rendered computer image can look completely
                different (and unsuitable) in reality and in different finishes.
                Professional expert painters of BD Service Point know a lot
                about paint finishes and their effect on different surfaces, and
                will, therefore, be able to guide you best in your selection.
              </p>

              <h4>Efficient and effective work with no wastage</h4>
              <p>
                Professional painting services have been doing their job for so
                long that they’re experts in determining how much paint is
                required for a project. This ensures that there is no paint
                wastage, thus, reducing your exterior painting costs as well. In
                fact, expert painters of BD Service Point give you a proper
                house painting cost estimate beforehand itself.
              </p>

              <h4>Neatness and cleanliness</h4>
              <p>
                If you’re getting an interiors paint job done, then there’s a
                high risk that your floor and furniture can get splattered with
                paint too. Professional expert painter of BD Service Point will
                take all the necessary measures to keep your house safe from
                spills and marks.
              </p>

              <h4>Time saving</h4>
              <p>
                Since professional building painting contractors work many jobs,
                they stick to the time schedule given to you and deliver results
                in a quick turnaround time. More importantly, since they do a
                great job in the first time round itself, you can be sure of
